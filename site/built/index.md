Computational social science (CSS) brings computational approaches to social science questions. [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) is a workflow management software which enables the writing of scalable and reproducible scientific workflows. With this half day workshop we will motivate the use of this powerful tool in operationalising reproducible research.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  prereq

### Prerequisites

This is a student led introductory lesson to computational workflows. No previous knowledge of Nextflow, other workflow software is required.

It is helpful to be familiar with using a programming language, to the level of [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder) or
[R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder), although this lesson does not specifically rely on Python or R. A full set of recommended courses and resources you can explore is covered in [Software Carpentry Lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). 

### Pre-Workshop Checklist 

- [ ] Bring own device to follow practical component
- [ ] Set up an account with GitHub
- [ ] Optionally, upgrade to a GitHub Education account

The workshop offers an overview to Nextflow. Nextflow integrates various software package and environment management systems such as Docker, Singularity, and Conda. It allows for existing pipelines written in common scripting languages, such as R and Python, to be seamlessly coupled together. It simplifies the implementation and running of workflows on cloud or high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.
