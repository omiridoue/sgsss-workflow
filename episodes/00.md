## What is FAIR?

FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable and comprises a set of principles designed to
increase the visibility and usefulness of your research to others.
The FAIR data principles, first published [in 2016][fair-data-principles], are widely known and applied today.
Similar [FAIR principles for software][fair-principles-research-software] have now been defined too. In general, they mean:

- **Findable** - software and its associated metadata must be easy to discover by humans and machines.
- **Accessible** - in order to reuse software, the software and its metadata must be retrievable by standard protocols, free and legally usable.
- **Interoperable** - when interacting with other software it must be done by exchanging data and/or metadata through
  standardised protocols and application programming interfaces (APIs).
- **Reusable** - software should be usable (can be executed) and reusable
  (can be understood, modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software).

Each of the above principles can be achieved by a number of practices listed below.
This is not an exact science, and by all means the list below is not exhaustive,
but any of the practices that you employ in your research software workflow will bring you
closer to the gold standard of fully reproducible research.

### Findable
- Create a description of your software to make it discoverable by search engines and other search tools
- Use standards (such as [CodeMeta][codemeta]) to describe interoperable metadata for your software (see [Research Software Metadata Guidelines][rsmd-g1])
- Place your software in a public software repository (and ideally register it in a [general-purpose or domain-specific software registry][awesome-rs-registries])
- Use a unique and persistent identifier (DOI) for your software (e.g. by depositing your code on [Zenodo][zenodo]),
  which is also useful for citations - note that depositing your data/code on GitHub and similar software repositories
  may not be enough as they may change their open access model or disappear completely in the future, so archiving your code means it stands a better chance at being preserved

### Accessible
- Make sure people can obtain get a copy your software using standard communication protocols (e.g. HTTP(S), (S)FTP, etc.)
- The code and its description (metadata) has to be available even when the software is no longer actively developed (this includes earlier versions of the software)

### Interoperable
- Use community-agreed standard formats for inputs and outputs of your software and its metadata
- Communicate with other software and tools via standard protocols and APIs

### Reusable
- Document your software (including its functionality, how to install and run it) so it is both usable (can be executed) 
and reusable (can be understood, modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software)
- Give a licence to your software clearly stating how it can be reused
