Computational social science (CSS) brings computational approaches to social science questions. [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) is a workflow management software which enables the writing of scalable and reproducible scientific workflows. With this half day workshop we will motivate the use of this powerful tool in operationalising reproducible research.

We will just about scratch the surface of CSS with this workshop so we'll work on a select few skills.

### 🗺️ Workshop Roadmap

__Core Competencies__

- [x] Ability to design and execute research projects from data to report
- [x] Navigate reproducible, efficient, and communicable code via GitHub

__Additional Skills__

- [x] Connecting with Computational Social Scientists

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The workshop offers an overview to Nextflow. Nextflow integrates various software package and environment management systems such as Docker, Singularity, and Conda. It allows for existing pipelines written in common scripting languages, such as R and Python, to be seamlessly coupled together. It simplifies the implementation and running of workflows on cloud or high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.

### 🗺️ Objectives

- [x] Understand the role of auxiliary tools (Docker/Git) in supporting best practice within the Open Research framework.
- [x] Design and adapt a research project directory to own research objectives.
- [x] Understand the fundamental components of a workflow implemented in Nextflow, including channels, processes and operators.
- [x] Learn-by-doing launch a computational workflow using remote workspace, GitPod.
- [x] Curate own configurations and settings on a practice workflow to ensure portability, scalability, automatic resource management and re-entrancy. 
- [x] Discuss ways to implement own research directory.
- [x] Explore links to the wider network for computational researchers across Scotland.

### Prerequisites

This is a student led introductory lesson to computational workflows. No previous knowledge of Nextflow, other workflow software is required.

It is helpful to be familiar with using a programming language, to the level of [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder) or
[R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder), although this lesson does not specifically rely on Python or R. A full set of recommended courses and resources you can explore is covered in [Software Carpentry Lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). 

### Pre-Workshop Checklist 

- [ ] Bring own device to follow practical component
- [ ] Set up an account with GitHub
- [ ] Optionally, upgrade to a GitHub Education account
